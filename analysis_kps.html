		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>The <a href="kps.html">Kirkpatrick-Seidel</a> algorithm sophisticated computational geometry algorithm
			used to find the convex hull of a set of points. Unlike the Jarvis March algorithm, which is more
			intuitive and straightforward, the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer approach,
			making it more efficient for large sets of points. It separates the points into upper and lower
			hulls, constructs bridges between these hulls, and combines them to form the final convex hull.
		</p>
		<p>The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm consists of the following key steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Separating Upper and Lower Hulls:</span> Begin by identifying the points with the
					least and most
					x-coordinates, which define a line separating the set of points into upper and lower portions.
					The points above this separating line, including the defining points, form the upper hull.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Handling Collinear Points:</span> Check pairs of points in the upper hull for
					collinearity. If two
					points have the same x-coordinate, remove one of them and insert the point with the larger
					y-coordinate into the set of candidate points.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Median Slope Calculation:</span> Calculate the slopes between pairs of points in
					the upper hull. Sort
					these slopes and determine the median slope.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Segregating Pairs by Slope:</span> Segregate pairs of points based on their
					slopes relative to the
					median slope. Three categories are formed: points with slopes less than the median, points with
					slopes equal to the median, and points with slopes greater than the median.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Finding Supporting Line:</span> Using the median slope, identify the supporting
					line by finding the
					maximum y-intercept among the points.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Selecting Candidate Points:</span> Select candidate points for bridge
					construction based on their
					positions relative to the supporting line and a vertical line.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Bridge Construction:</span> Construct bridges iteratively using the selected
					candidate points until only
					two points or fewer remain. This ensures efficient connection of the outermost points to form
					the convex hull.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="b">Combining Upper and Lower Hulls:</span> Repeat similar steps to construct the
					lower hull. Once both
					upper and lower hulls are obtained, combine them by connecting the outermost points from each
					hull to form the final convex hull.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm offers a more efficient approach to computing the convex hull compared
			to simpler algorithms like Jarvis March, especially for large sets of points. By leveraging the
			divide-and-conquer strategy, it achieves better computational complexity, making it suitable for various
			applications in computational geometry and beyond.

			<li><strong>Flipping the points</strong><br>
				We need to flip the points to create a geometric mirror image. Since the algorithm focuses on computing
				the upper hull hence after computing the upper hull we will need to compute the lower hull where flipped

				The function below helps us in flipping the points</li>

			<li><strong>Function to find the median slope efficiently</strong><br>
				A key step in the Kirkpatrick-seidel algorithm is efficiently finding the “upper bridge” between two
				sets of points split by a vertical line. This process requires determining the median slope of lines
				connecting pairs of points from each subset. The <em>quickSelect()</em> function defined as follows
				enables us to calculate the median slope efficiently.<br>
				The function is called with an array of slopes and a target index for the median. It partitions the
				array around a pivot chosen at random, ensuring that elements smaller than the pivot are moved to its
				left and larger elements to its right. This process is repeated recursively on the partition containing
				the target index until the pivot is precisely at the target index, effectively finding the median
				without fully sorting the array.</li>
		</ol>
		<pre><code>function  quickSelect(ls, index, lo  =  0, hi  =  null, depth  =  0) {
			 if (hi  ===  null) {
			  hi  =  ls.length -  1;
			 }
			
			 if (lo  ===  hi) {
			  return  ls[lo];
			 }
			const  pivot  =  Math.floor(Math.random() * (hi  -  lo  +  1) +  lo);
			[ls[lo], ls[pivot]] = [ls[pivot], ls[lo]];
			let  cur  =  lo;
			
			for (let  run  =  lo  +  1; run  &lt;=  hi; run++) {
			if (ls[run] &lt;  ls[lo]) {
			 cur++;
			 [ls[cur], ls[run]] = [ls[run], ls[cur]];
			 }
			}
			
			[ls[cur], ls[lo]] = [ls[lo], ls[cur]];
			
			if (index  &lt;  cur) {
			return  quickSelect(ls, index, lo, cur  -  1, depth  +  1);
			} 
			else  if (index  &gt;  cur) {
			return  quickSelect(ls, index, cur  +  1, hi, depth  +  1);

				<p><strong>Computing the bridge</strong><br>
					The concept of a bridge is a line segment that connects two points, one from each side of the
					partitioned set, that is part of the convex hull.<br>
					The <code>bridge()</code> function is a part of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm’s implementation
					for computing the convex hull of a set of points. Its specific role is to find a “bridge” between
					two sets of points, divided by a vertical line, that contributes to forming the convex hull.<br>
					Here’s a detailed breakdown of what the <code>bridge</code> function does:</p>
				<p><strong>Sort Points</strong>: Sorts the points by their x-coordinate and partitions them into left
					(<code>L</code>) and right (<code>R</code>) sets based on a vertical line.</p>
				<p><strong>Pair Points and Calculate Slopes</strong>: Pairs points from the sorted list and calculates
					slopes between each pair. Identifies any odd point not part of any pair.</p>
				<p><strong>Find Median Slope</strong>: Uses the quickSelect algorithm to find the median slope among the
					calculated slopes.</p>
				<p><strong>Identify Bridge Candidates</strong>: Based on the median slope, it identifies points that
					could be part of the bridge by comparing slopes and positions relative to <code>L</code> and
					<code>R</code>.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Recursive Pruning</strong>: Recursively narrows down the set of candidate points by pruning
					points unlikely to be part of the convex hull based on geometric criteria and the median slope.</p>
				<p><strong>Determine and Return the Bridge</strong>: Eventually identifies and returns the bridge, a
					line segment connecting a point from <code>L</code> to a point in <code>R</code>, which is part of
					the convex hull.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Finding the upper hull</strong><br>
					Part of the convex hull which represents the upper boundary of the convex polygon<br>
					The function <code>upperHull()</code>calculates the upper convex hull of a set of 2D points. It
					sorts the input points based on their x-coordinates, then iterates over each point. For each point,
					it checks if the current point forms a counter-clockwise turn with the last two points in the upper
					hull. If it doesn’t, it removes the last point in the upper hull until a counter-clockwise turn is
					formed. Finally, it returns the upper convex hull.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Main function</strong><br>
					The function<code>KPS(points)</code> implements the Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm to compute the
					convex hull of a set of 2D points. It first computes the upper hull of the points and then computes
					the lower hull of the points. It ensures that the last point of the upper hull and the first point
					of the lower hull are not repeated. Finally, it concatenates the upper and lower hulls to form the
					convex hull.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Simulation</strong><br>
					The function simulates <code>KPSSimulator(points)</code> each step of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel
					algorithm. It computes the upper hull, lower hull, and convex hull separately, and returns an array
					of objects representing each step. Each object contains the type of step (‘Upper Hull’, ‘Lower
					Hull’, or ‘Convex Hull’) and the points involved in that step. This function is useful for
					visualizing the algorithm’s progression and understanding each step.</p>
