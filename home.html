				Algorithms
			</h2>
			<p>The project, "Web-based Visualization of Convex Hull Using Jarvis March and Kirkpatrick-Seidel
				Algorithms" aims to provide a visual representation of the Convex Hull of a given set of points using
				two
				different algorithms: Jarvis March and Kirkpatrick-Seidel. We Used JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the
				front-end of this project.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project provides an interactive platform for understanding and visualizing the Jarvis March and
				Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithms for computing the convex hull of a set of points. Users can experiment
				with
				different sets of points and observe how these algorithms work in action.

			<h2 id="jarvis-march">Jarvis March</h2>
			<p>The <a href="jm.html">Jarvis March</a> algorithm is a computational geometry algorithm that finds the
				convex hull of a set of points. Jarvis March, also known as the gift-wrapping algorithm, is a method
				used in computational geometry to find the convex hull of a set of points. A convex hull is formed by
				stretching a rubber band around the outermost points in a set.</p>
			<p>Here’s how the Jarvis March algorithm works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Finding the leftmost point:</span> This is guaranteed to be part of the convex
						hull.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Selecting the next point:</span> Look at all the remaining points and determine
						which one is the most
						counterclockwise relative to the current point. If there are ties, it means that if multiple
						points lie on the same line, choose the farthest one. This ensures the hull is as wide as
						possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Repeating:</span> This process should be continued, moving to the most
						counterclockwise point each time
						till you loop back to the starting point.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Completion:</span> Once you return to the initial point, the set of points you’ve
						accumulated forms the
						convex hull.
					</p>
				</li>

			<h2 id="jarvis-march">Kirkpatrick-Seidel</h2>
			<p>The <a href="kps.html">Kirkpatrick-Seidel</a> algorithm sophisticated computational geometry algorithm
				used to find the convex hull of a set of points. Unlike the Jarvis March algorithm, which is more
				intuitive and straightforward, the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer approach,
				making it more efficient for large sets of points. It separates the points into upper and lower
				hulls, constructs bridges between these hulls, and combines them to form the final convex hull.
			</p>
			<p>The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm consists of the following key steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Separating Upper and Lower Hulls:</span> Begin by identifying the points with the
						least and most
						x-coordinates, which define a line separating the set of points into upper and lower portions.
						The points above this separating line, including the defining points, form the upper hull.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Handling Collinear Points:</span> Check pairs of points in the upper hull for
						collinearity. If two
						points have the same x-coordinate, remove one of them and insert the point with the larger
						y-coordinate into the set of candidate points.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Median Slope Calculation:</span> Calculate the slopes between pairs of points in
						the upper hull. Sort
						these slopes and determine the median slope.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Segregating Pairs by Slope:</span> Segregate pairs of points based on their
						slopes relative to the
						median slope. Three categories are formed: points with slopes less than the median, points with
						slopes equal to the median, and points with slopes greater than the median.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Finding Supporting Line:</span> Using the median slope, identify the supporting
						line by finding the
						maximum y-intercept among the points.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Selecting Candidate Points:</span> Select candidate points for bridge
						construction based on their
						positions relative to the supporting line and a vertical line.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Bridge Construction:</span> Construct bridges iteratively using the selected
						candidate points until only
						two points or fewer remain. This ensures efficient connection of the outermost points to form
						the convex hull.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Combining Upper and Lower Hulls:</span> Repeat similar steps to construct the
						lower hull. Once both
						upper and lower hulls are obtained, combine them by connecting the outermost points from each
						hull to form the final convex hull.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm offers a more efficient approach to computing the convex hull compared
				to simpler algorithms like Jarvis March, especially for large sets of points. By leveraging the
				divide-and-conquer strategy, it achieves better computational complexity, making it suitable for various
				applications in computational geometry and beyond.
