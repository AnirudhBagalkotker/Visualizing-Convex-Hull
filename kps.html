			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The <a href="kps.html">Kirkpatrick-Seidel</a> algorithm sophisticated computational geometry algorithm
				used to find the convex hull of a set of points. Unlike the Jarvis March algorithm, which is more
				intuitive and straightforward, the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer approach,
				making it more efficient for large sets of points. It separates the points into upper and lower
				hulls, constructs bridges between these hulls, and combines them to form the final convex hull.

			<h2>Algorithm</h2>
			<p>Hereâ€™s how the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Separating Upper and Lower Hulls:</span> Begin by identifying the points with the
						least and most
						x-coordinates, which define a line separating the set of points into upper and lower portions.
						The points above this separating line, including the defining points, form the upper hull.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Handling Collinear Points:</span> Check pairs of points in the upper hull for
						collinearity. If two
						points have the same x-coordinate, remove one of them and insert the point with the larger
						y-coordinate into the set of candidate points.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Median Slope Calculation:</span> Calculate the slopes between pairs of points in
						the upper hull. Sort
						these slopes and determine the median slope.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Segregating Pairs by Slope:</span> Segregate pairs of points based on their
						slopes relative to the
						median slope. Three categories are formed: points with slopes less than the median, points with
						slopes equal to the median, and points with slopes greater than the median.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Finding Supporting Line:</span> Using the median slope, identify the supporting
						line by finding the
						maximum y-intercept among the points.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Selecting Candidate Points:</span> Select candidate points for bridge
						construction based on their
						positions relative to the supporting line and a vertical line.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Bridge Construction:</span> Construct bridges iteratively using the selected
						candidate points until only
						two points or fewer remain. This ensures efficient connection of the outermost points to form
						the convex hull.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><span class="b">Combining Upper and Lower Hulls:</span> Repeat similar steps to construct the
						lower hull. Once both
						upper and lower hulls are obtained, combine them by connecting the outermost points from each
						hull to form the final convex hull.
					</p>
				</li>
